<h1> HI! My name is Zaheer Rizvi.</h1>

<img src="twitter_pic.jpg" >

<p> I grew up in Mercervile, NJ and move to the Bay area after 8th grade. That was when
my passion for computers started. I was a natural, everything just made sense. I am writing 
this bio for my data analytics and visulizations class at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Now I live in Rochester, MN. Why Minnesota? Because I love winter!!!
